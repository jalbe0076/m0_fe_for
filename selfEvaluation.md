# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
I understand the concept but it takes me a little longer to wrap my head around some of the challenges and what code to use. Mostly because I need to google what strings do what to get the desired output. 
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
My struggle was productive, the MDN site was very helpful to find and explain what I needed to use.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I think I still need some progressively challenging scenarios to run through. I think goggling some simple for loop scenario challenges could potentially prove useful. 
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I thnk I need to take some notes on more commonly used functions as writing things down help me remember it a little better.
